1. Fetch data from firefly -- for now, we can just fetch the whole list and keep it in memory in the browser
2. set up calendar view, with monthly navigation, and change between accounts
3. think on what cards of each calendar should hold -- maybe total sum + count of transactions if more than 1, and simplified view if just 1 -- maybe instead of 1 some kind of LOW count
4. clicking into a card gives full day-view with all the transactions
5. optionally clicking a transaction gives more view? but maybe doing too much not sure



NOW TODOS
1. create nginx proxy with cors options for *
2. make sure it goes to :80 and revereses into whatever firefly is
